# Background
So I was bored. REALLY BORED. So I think back to the CS50 lecture I learnt about HTML and I was amazed! I decided
I wanted to make my own website. So I took a bunch of youtube links and created YouLinks. Then I started getting these ideas for a calculator and whatnot so I go to W3Schools, Learn a bunch of stuff about JavaScript and create YouCalc and YouList!
And then I learnt about Flask. My mind was blown again, so I forgot all about this stuff and moved on to my other courses.
