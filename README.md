# Background
It all started when I was watching the CS50 HTML Lecture and I was amazed at how easily Prof. Malan made...Google! Then I decided to make my own website. So I took a bunch of youtube links and created YouLinks. Then I started getting these ideas for a calculator and whatnot so I go to W3Schools, learn a bunch of stuff about JavaScript and create YouCalc and YouList!
And then I learnt about Flask. My mind was blown again, so I forget all about this stuff and moved on to my other courses.
